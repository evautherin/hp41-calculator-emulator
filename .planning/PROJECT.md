# HP-41 Calculator Emulator

## Current State

**v4.2 Help Search Enrichment — SHIPPED 2026-06-05.** The `?` help overlay is now an intent-aware function finder: an invisible `search_aliases` match surface (DE+EN) on all six help pools, a hand-rolled tiered+fuzzy matcher (exact > prefix > substring > fuzzy, zero new deps) mirrored CLI↔GUI, 364 implemented entries aliased, plus a CI schema gate + CLI↔GUI parity fixture locking it in. All 18 v1 requirements satisfied; milestone audit `tech_debt` (no functional gaps — cross-phase integration verified end-to-end). `hp41-core` untouched. Shipped as PR #23 (develop→main).

**v4.1 iOS Foundation — SHIPPED 2026-06-04.** The HP-41 runs on iPhone (Tauri v2 + React, shared `hp41-core`): iOS sandbox persistence, touch-first UI, app lifecycle/clock, and a **manual-signing `ci-ios` pipeline** that delivers a signed IPA to TestFlight (installed + verified on a physical device). All 25 requirements satisfied; milestone audit PASSED. Desktop/macOS behavior unchanged (iOS paths `isIos`/`#[cfg(mobile)]`-gated).

**Deferred (before any public App Store release):** wire `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` into the shipped bundle (tracked todo) + store assets + Apple review.

**Active milestone: v4.3 Hardware Fidelity** — in progress. Closing the remaining *genuine* behavioral gaps vs. real HP-41CX hardware, anchored on interrupting control-alarm execution (program-engine re-entrancy, D-40-04), plus an audit-selected set of further divergences. First substantive `hp41-core` engine work since the v3.x module era.

**Phase 63 complete (2026-06-06): Run-Loop Yield Engine + Interrupting Alarms + PSE/VIEW-AVIEW.** Built the synchronous pending-interrupt mechanism in `run_loop` (synthetic XEQ frame at the next instruction boundary, periodic Phase-C `check_alarms`, ack-after-RTN reschedule, 4-level cap honored) and mid-run display yields (PSE/VIEW/AVIEW render-and-resume), wired across CLI and GUI — the GUI gained its first continuous program run loop (`run_program`/`resume_program` Tauri commands + a no-poll TS yield driver, D-11). ALARM-02/03 + PRGM-01/02 satisfied; verification 5/5 (3 visual UAT items pending). Two parity gaps surfaced by review were fixed in-cycle (CLI alarm-launched yield drain; GUI idle alarm → `run_program`).

**Phase 64 complete (2026-06-07): Interactive GETKEY.** GETKEY inside a running program now suspends on a new `YieldKind::WaitForKey` (reusing the Phase 63 yield engine — no new `Op` variant), and resumes via `resume_program_with_key(keycode)` which pushes the key's HP-41 row×col code to X with `LiftEffect::Enable`; Esc/cancel → sentinel 0. Wired across CLI (non-blocking poll+redraw, never freezes) and GUI (Tauri command + permission; no-poll key-event resume, D-11), completing CLI↔GUI parity (D-25.6). `getkey_captured_code` is a transient `#[serde(default, skip)]` field (save-file compat preserved); R/S keycode doc error corrected 84→31. PRGM-03 satisfied; verification 4/4. Code review found 2 critical/3 warning/2 info — CR-01 (a missing guard letting a spurious/racing resume clobber a live PSE/VIEW yield) fixed in-cycle with a regression test.

**Phase 65 complete (2026-06-07): Standalone Fidelity Fixes.** Four independent HP-41CX gaps closed. **MATH-01 (the substantive one):** `HpNum` re-architected from a `Decimal` newtype to a normalized `{mantissa: Decimal, exponent: i8}` pair covering the full HP-41 range ±9.999999999E±99 (ADR v4.3-005, amending the rust_decimal Frozen Invariant) — `FACT(27..=69)` now returns correct 10-sig scientific-notation results (FACT(69)≈1.711E98) instead of Overflow; backward-compatible untagged serde round-trips v1.0–v4.2 saves; zero new deps. **DISP-01/02/03:** CLI renders `state.display_override`; CHS toggles the entry-buffer sign in place (no flush/lift); AON (flag 48) auto-displays the ALPHA register at rest on both CLI (`ui.rs`) and GUI (`types.rs` `from_state`), all with matching precedence (D-10/D-25.6). MATH-01/DISP-01/02/03 satisfied; verification 4/4 automated (4 visual UAT items pending). Code review found 2 critical/5 warning/3 info — **CR-01 (silent exponent-wrap: large-exponent `checked_mul`/`checked_div` narrowed the i32 exponent `as i8` before the range check, so `1e80×1e80` returned ~1e-58 instead of Overflow)** fixed in-cycle by widening `from_sci` to range-check in i32, with dedicated large-exponent regression tests (the proptest generator clamped exponents to ±18, hiding it); remaining warnings fixed, Advantage matrix-op large-range limits documented (D-65-01, out of scope). CI lint green (stable + MSRV 1.88).

<summary>v4.1 iOS Foundation (shipped 2026-06-04 — see <code>milestones/v4.1-ROADMAP.md</code>)</summary>

**Goal:** Bring the HP-41 emulator to iPhone with a touch-first UI and a working signed build distributed via TestFlight — laying the foundation for a later App Store release.

**Target features (foundation-first, iPhone-only):**
- Build-approach decision — research evaluates Tauri v2 Mobile vs. native SwiftUI + Rust FFI; outcome captured as an ADR
- iOS build pipeline — `hp41-core` compiles to `aarch64-apple-ios`; app runs in the simulator and on a real device
- Touch-first UI — skin/keys adapted for iPhone (touch targets, portrait, safe areas, no hardware-keyboard dependency)
- iOS persistence — app-sandbox path instead of `~/.hp41/` (autosave in the iOS Documents container)
- Signing + TestFlight — provisioning/code-signing with the Apple Developer cert; build distributed via TestFlight

**Explicitly out of scope (deferred to a follow-up milestone):** App Store submission, store assets, Apple review, and "HP-41" trademark navigation. `hp41-core` stays UI-agnostic — mobile is another adapter; the workspace Frozen Invariant is preserved.

## Current Milestone: v4.3 Hardware Fidelity

**Goal:** Close the remaining genuine behavioral gaps between the emulator and real HP-41CX hardware — anchored on interrupting control-alarm execution.

**Target work:**
- **Interrupting Control Alarms (D-40-04)** — make program execution re-entrant against the 4-level call stack so a fired control alarm can interrupt the calculator (including a running program), execute its designated program, and return cleanly. The data model already exists (D-38.4); only execution is missing.
- **Fidelity audit** — an early audit phase inventories *real* remaining divergences (real-hardware behavior vs. emulator) and produces a prioritized list; an audit-selected handful are closed this milestone.
- Deliberately-accepted divergences (emulator extensions, host-clock policy, oracle corrections) stay untouched by design.

**Out of scope:** iOS App Store submission (handled externally). Android (parked as `SEED-001`).

**Active requirements:** defined in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` for this milestone.

## What This Is

A faithful Rust-based behavioral emulation of the HP-41C/CV/CX programmable RPN calculator, delivered as a keyboard-driven TUI CLI (`hp41-cli`) and a Tauri v2 desktop GUI (`hp41-gui`), both backed by a UI-agnostic core library (`hp41-core`). v3.3 shipped 2026-05-26 with the complete ROM built-in set (~130 ops) plus four XROM application modules: Math Pac I (XROM 7, ~55 entry points), Stat 1 Pac (XROM 2, 26 entry points), Time Module (XROM 26, 35 entry points), and Advantage Pac (XROM 22+24, ~117 entry points) — all feature-complete per their respective Owner's Manuals.

## Core Value

Faithful HP-41 RPN fidelity — the four-level stack, stack-lift semantics, display, and keystroke programming must behave identically to the original hardware; everything else is secondary.

### Active

_No active milestone. v4.2 Help Search Enrichment shipped 2026-06-05 (PR #23, develop→main). Run `/gsd-new-milestone` to define the next._

_Carried-over deferred items: `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` bundle wiring before any public iOS App Store release (from v4.1, pending todo); HSCOV-01 (zero-result / missed-query logging) remains v2/deferred._

### Out of Scope

- FR-18 Multiple skin themes — GUI-only, post-v3.x
- FR-22 `.raw` HP-41 program file import/export — could-have
- iPhone (iOS) — now IN SCOPE for v4.1 iOS Foundation (desktop-stable precondition met at v4.0); iPad and Android remain deferred
- Binary releases (signed cross-platform CLI + GUI installers via cargo-dist + tauri-action) — deferred post-v3.3
- X-MEM / Extended Memory file model — post-v3.x scope
- ~~Interrupting control alarm execution — data model ready (D-38.4), requires re-entrancy against 4-level call stack~~ → ✓ **Implemented in v4.3 Phase 63** (synchronous pending-interrupt at the run_loop boundary; ADR v4.3-004)
- Cycle-accurate Nut CPU simulation — high effort, low user value vs. behavioral emulation
- HP-copyrighted ROM image redistribution — legal risk, excluded permanently
- HP-IL peripheral emulation — niche, complex
- Wand/barcode reader emulation — requires hardware, very niche
- Cloud sync — privacy and infrastructure cost

## Context

The project shipped v1.0 through v3.3 in 21 days (2026-05-06 → 2026-05-26) across 47 phases and 8 milestones.

**Codebase metrics (v3.3 ship, 2026-05-26):**

| Component | Source LOC | Test LOC | Tests |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `hp41-core/src` | 46,683 | 38,426 | 2,950 |
| `hp41-cli/src` | 6,966 | 6,008 | 421 |
| `hp41-gui/src-tauri/src` | 3,458 | — | — |
| `hp41-gui/src` (React/TS) | 4,883 | — | — |
| **Total Rust** | **101,541** | | **3,371** |

**XROM module LOC breakdown in `hp41-core/src/ops/`:**

| Module | XROM ID | LOC | Ops |
|--------|---------|-----|-----|
| `math1/` | 7 | 12,816 | ~55 |
| `stat1/` | 2 | 6,898 | 26 |
| `time/` | 26 | 4,556 | 35 |
| `advantage/` | 22+24 | 10,872 | ~117 |

**Quality gates (v3.3):** `hp41-core` region coverage ~95% (denominator dilution from 4 XROM modules), numerical accuracy 98.86% (843 cases), 0 panics, 0 Free42 contamination symbols, MSRV 1.88, zero new runtime deps across v3.0–v3.3, CI green on Windows/macOS/Ubuntu.

**Op enum:** ~325 variants in `hp41-core/src/ops/mod.rs` — all subject to the 4-way exhaustive-match invariant (dispatch + execute_op + CLI prgm_display + GUI prgm_display).

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Rust stable, MSRV 1.88 — deterministic, GC-free, ideal for emulation core
- **Task runner**: `just` — sole task runner; no bare `cargo` commands in CI or docs
- **Architecture**: `hp41-core` must never depend on `hp41-cli` or `hp41-gui` — enforced at compile time
- **Dependencies**: ratatui 0.30, crossterm 0.29, clap 4.x, serde/serde_json, rust_decimal, criterion (dev), Tauri v2.11 + React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (GUI)
- **Zero runtime dep policy (v3.0+)**: No new runtime deps across v3.0–v3.3; `statrs` and `libc` both rejected
- **Legal**: No HP-copyrighted ROM bytes; Free42 GPL contamination guard CI-enforced (18-token scan)
- **Privacy**: No telemetry; local-only data storage; no network calls (except `SystemTime::now()` syscall)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Behavioral emulation, not cycle-accurate Nut CPU | High effort, low user value | ✓ Good — users don't notice |
| Cargo workspace `hp41-core` / `hp41-cli` | Enforces clean separation; GUI is thin adapter | ✓ Good — `hp41-core` reused unchanged through v3.3 |
| `rust_decimal` for HpNum with 10-digit rounding | BCD-accurate without custom BCD struct | ✓ Good — 98.86% accuracy suite pass rate (843 cases) |
| Stack-lift as `lift_enabled: bool` in Stack | Simplest correct model for 130+ ops | ✓ Good — every op explicitly declares effect |
| ISG/DSE counter fields via string-split | Never use `floor()`/`fmod()` on f64 | ✓ Good — hardware-identical counter behavior; reused for Time Pac date parsing |
| ratatui + crossterm for TUI | Cross-platform, keyboard-driven, stable | ✓ Good — CI green on all 3 platforms |
| `just` as sole task runner | All targets as recipes; contributors never call bare `cargo` | ✓ Good — CI compliance enforced |
| No async in hp41-core | Single-threaded event loop; clock reads via `SystemTime::now()` | ✓ Good — simpler, deterministic |
| `serde_json` for persistence | Human-readable, diff-able, forward-compatible | ✓ Good — v1.0→v3.3 save files load without migration |
| XROM resolver chain fires LAST (v3.0) | `xrom_resolve` after `builtin_card_op`; Pitfall 1 | ✓ Good — 5 modules coexist cleanly |
| Hand-coded distribution primitives (v3.1) | Zero new runtime deps; `statrs` rejected | ✓ Good — ~140 LOC replaces ~50K dep; scipy-verified |
| Direct `SystemTime::now()` in hp41-core (v3.2) | Syscall, not I/O; trait injection rejected | ✓ Good — `time_offset_secs` delta model is simple + testable |
| Fliegel-Van Flandern JDN calendar (v3.2) | Pure Rust; `libc::localtime_r` rejected | ✓ Good — ~60 LOC; no new runtime deps |
| Named-matrix `Vec<AdvMatrix>` model (v3.3) | Math Pac I isolation (D-43.5); `HashMap` rejected | ✓ Good — deterministic serde; separate from R14/R15+ |
| Dual XROM ID design ADV 22+24 (v3.3) | Hardware-faithful two-chip design | ✓ Good — 12 intentional MATH_1 overlaps handled cleanly |
| FROOT Laguerre's method (v3.3) | Arbitrary degree; coexists with Math Pac I Bairstow (degree 2–5) | ✓ Good — converges for all test cases incl. complex roots |
| Persistent TVM state (v3.3) | `serde(default)` without `skip` — second instance after `rand_seed` | ✓ Good — TVM register contents survive save/load |

*Last updated: 2026-06-10 — **v4.3 Hardware Fidelity milestone COMPLETE** (all 6 phases): 62 (alarm-semantics ADR), 63 (run-loop yield engine + interrupting alarms + PSE/VIEW/AVIEW), 64 (interactive GETKEY), 65 (standalone fidelity fixes: HpNum ±9.999E±99 range/FACT + DISP-01/02/03), 66 (verification + divergence docs + quality gates), and 67 (Reset Escape Hatch). **Phase 67:** two-tier in-app reset (RESET-01) — `CalcState::soft_reset()` (clears transient/input-trapping state, preserves stored data) + `memory_lost()` (factory), wired OUTSIDE the dispatch path (CLI `Ctrl+R`→s/f; GUI/iOS ON-key tap=soft / long-press=portaled MEMORY LOST=full), autosave overwritten synchronously so recovery survives restart; ADR v4.3-007 + D-CV-10 record the intentional divergence from hardware ON semantics. Code review found + fixed CR-02 (cancel_requested Arc orphaned across reset → GUI cancellation breakage); both gates green. Next: tag `v4.3` on develop, then `gh pr merge 26 --merge` (NEVER --squash).*
